## **üìú Requirement Objective**  

This is focuses on **PostgreSQL** database operations. You will create and manage three tables (**books, customers, orders**), insert sample data, and perform essential SQL queries. Key tasks include **CRUD operations, constraints, JOINs, aggregations, filtering, and data manipulation** to reinforce your understanding of relational databases.

## **üìÇ Database Setup**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Install PostgreSQL** on your system if it is not already installed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Open **pgAdmin** or your PostgreSQL terminal.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a new database** named **"bookstore_db"** or any appropriate name.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Connect** to the newly created database.

## **üìÇ Table Creation**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a "books" table** with the following fields:

- `id` (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each book.
- `title`: The name of the book.
- `author`: The author of the book.
- `price`: The price of the book (must be non-negative, enforced via CHECK constraint).
- `stock`: The number of available copies in stock.
- `published_year`: The year the book was published.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a "customers" table** with the following fields:

- `id` (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each customer.
- `name`: The full name of the customer.
- `email`: The email address of the customer (must be unique).
- `joined_date`: The date the customer registered (default to the current date).

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Create an "orders" table** with the following fields:

- `id` (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each order.
- `customer_id` (Foreign Key): References the `id` field in the "customers" table.
- `book_id` (Foreign Key): References the `id` field in the "books" table.
- `quantity`: The number of books ordered (must be greater than zero).
